                            <p class="our-story"> It all started one summer in the living room of their mutual friend's home. After many laughs, late night heart-to-hearts in front of the fireplace, shared love for good food and adventure, and discovering their endless source of silliness, they fell in love.
                                On the evening of their first date at Granville Island, Jason asked Kelsey, "Will you be my girlfriend?" and she said "Yes."
                                Four years later, on the evening of their anniversary, they went back to Granville Island. Jason asked Kelsey, "Will you marry me?" and she said "Yes."

                                        I first met Jason our first year at USC while he was disguised as Ichigo Kurosaki and neither of us would know it, but that was the start of a friendship filled with photos and knives. Through many a visit to Vancouver, I’ve had the opportunity to watch his relationship with Kelsey (and Cleo) transform Jason from the comic-relief into a caring partner and dog-dad. Of course, when I first saw the two together and that Kelsey embraced Jason’s many lovable “quirks”, I knew it was a perfect match. Getting to take their engagement photos was an immense honor, watching everything come together at their wedding will be an even greater honor.

                                        I first met Kelsey in Grade 8, when we were still awkward high school students and our lives were filled with teen drama and gossip. Although we drifted apart after graduation, we reconnected again – thanks to Kerri and also thanks to coincidentally working in the same office building in downtown Vancouver – and have become the close friends we are today. From our girls nights in chatting over wine and yummy food to our days relaxing on the lake and falling asleep under the hot sun – I will always cherish those times. It didn’t take long for me to see why Kelsey and Jason were such a great couple. Not only do they challenge one another to be better, they seamlessly match each other in kindness, consideration and compassion. Simply put, they complete each other like peanut butter and jelly. I’m so honoured to be a part of their special day and see two of my favourite people get married!

                                        When I was 13, I moved to Wuhan and joined the school there. On my first day, I was sat in the principal's office, and he said, "Jacob, here is your buddy for your first week, who will show you where your classes are and help you settle in, etc." The door opens, and my "buddy" steps in. My gaze first rested upon the head of luscious black locks, permed into a freestanding sculpture. His beady little eyes were like an eager puppy's, his lips covered in shards of skin like broken glass on a high wall. His mouth widens, and widens, and widens, into a big grin, revealing a network of metal wires. The light catches on it, I put my hands up to shield my eyes from the glare. "Hi, I'm Jason!", he says, as his fingers swiftly and deftly demonstrates the hand signs for Sasuke's fireball jutsu. My mortal mind struggling to make sense of the vision before me, all I could formulate in my head was just three words. "What. A. Dweeb."
                                        <br><br>
                                        And somehow, this dweeb managed to pull the greatest con in history and fooled Kelsey into thinking he was a smooth L.A. boy, and even got her to agree to spend the rest of their lives together. And I just have to see this with my own eyes.

                                        Hi, I’m Kerri! I met Kelsey back in high school and we became inseparable. While we fell out of touch after high school and thought that was the end of our friendship, Kelsey and I bumped into each other some years later. We took it as a sign and made plans to meet and catch up; it felt like old times and like we never missed a beat with each other. Following our reconnection, I met Jason at one of Kelsey’s get-togethers (he made quite the impression by showing off his abs) and the three of us started hanging out almost daily (this had, shockingly enough, nothing to do with his abs). 
                                        <br><br>
                                        To say I love them so much is an understatement. Knowing how both Kelsey and Jason are, I feel they truly complement each other; I find Jason the slightly more responsible one, while Kelsey is the more care-free one - it certainly keeps the relationship alive haha. Jokes aside, I feel truly blessed and honoured to see how they both have grown so much. I can see how much Jason cares for Kelsey, even before they started dating. And not just with Kelsey, but with all the people around him - friends and strangers. And I know Kelsey has worked a lot on herself to become as mature as she is to this day for a trusting relationship. They both have grown so much and I am so lucky to have seen what a dedicated, committed, nurturing, loving relationship looks like throughout the last few years. Despite all the little teases Jason does with Kelsey and in front of friends, he always does it in a way that makes her laugh, and no matter how many of the same embarassing stories Jason tells about me, it always makes me laugh too. I am glad fate brought Kelsey and I back together and to have such a privilege to spend so much of my time with them - whether they are near or far. They will always be my closest friends and I am truly so happy to be part of this special day with them.

                                        I first met Jason in Wuhan, spending our formative years together as students at Wuhan Yangtze International School (WYIS). Some of my favorite memories with Jason include spending too much money on boba and noodles, spending too much time at internet cafes and playing Halo, and spending too little time studying for AP Physics. Jason and I both moved to Los Angeles after WYIS, and got to have our fair share of sullungtang in Koreatown. I'm beyond excited for Jason and Kelsey's special day -- clearly Jason married up. :D

                                        I first met Kelsey and Jason as part of our church life group - Jason was our fearless leader and Kelsey was a bundle of (very tired) sunshine that helped 12 complete strangers become friends. I’ll never forget fishbowl charades or enjoying delicious KBBQ together! I’ve treasured Kelsey’s friendship over the last few years - her honesty, encouragement, and kindness have meant the world to me! I’ve seen her grow so much as a person and in her love for Jason, and I’m so honoured to get to be a part of her special day. ♥

                                        I first met Jason and Kelsey when I crashed their church life group’s retreat. Jason and I ended up sharing a room together and had some heart-to-heart conversations into the late night. Since then, I have learned many “self-defence” techniques from him. I’ll never forget our board game nights and how Kelsey endured 2 hours of Jason and me screaming “THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!” while we struggled to survive in the game ‘Cuphead’, which ultimately ended in laughter at the impossibility of the game and how ludicrous we were being. I’m looking forward to and am very excited and honoured to be a part of their special day!

                                        I met Kelsey after a psychology class in UBC, both of us stayed after class to ask the prof questions about industrial psychology. Although neither of us ended up going down that route, we bonded over the fact that we were both nerds and keeners in school. It took me a VERY long time to finally see her wild party side after we had been friends for years. My favorite memories with Kelsey and Jason were the many late night conversations we had whenever we visited Vancouver outside of Michael's (my now husband, thanks to Kelsey's introduction 😉) parents' house. After each of those heart-to-heart chats, Jason somehow would always decide to start doing long jumps and boasting about how far he jumped based on his footprints in the snow/lawn. Would it be a good idea to ask him to recreate that during the wedding? 😂

                                        Jason and I became friends during our freshman year at USC because we were both in a coding class together. I thought the class was difficult, so I tried to buddy up to the most approachable person who seemed smarter than me- and that was Jason LOL. Thus began a 4 year journey of staying up late studying, partnering on projects, and attending / skipping class together (jury is out on if we attended or skipped more). Post grad, I've been fortunate enough to meet up with Jason and Kelsey once or twice a year and it's always been a memorable time. Honored to be a part of the festivities for two of my favorite people :3

                                        I went to high school with Kelsey but it wasn't until Philosophy 100 at UBC that I really got to know her (and how weird she really was)...and that's how we hit it off! Even though I'm on Team Bride, I've actually known Jason for much longer (since he was a little kid basically). I'd like to think that I was the catalyst that made this marriage happen because they met through me, at my house! I will always remember their first interactions. Even before they got together, I could tell from the darting gazes and happy giggles that something special was brewing in the air. And from that budding affection sprung a giant tree with roots dug deep. I'm happy and honoured to have witnessed their journey in finding each other!

                                        I first met Kelsey and Jason as part of a church small group and really got to know Kelsey when we continued to meet as a trio throughout COVID. I remember hopping on full day video calls with Kelsey while she got used to working from home, where I witnessed her and Jason’s love for mandarin oranges and her many other quirks! Helping Jason creatively put their bed together after moving while jamming to anime OSTs and hearing about their adventures and washroom-related stories from all over the world have also been memories I’ll cherish. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        It's been such a privilege to see them both grow and learn to love each other more - it’s so evident that they live and breathe acts of service, thoughtfulness, and compassion in their relationship! I love the way Kelsey lights up and steals glances when Jason shares a story, one of his “it’s actually quite simple” teachings, or one of his 100% confidence moments. I admire the way Jason cares for every single detail in Kelsey’s life with the utmost attention, care, and patience - if you get the chance, ask Kelsey about how her portable battery is always “fully charged”! I’m so honoured to get to be with you two on your special day and marry you! ♥
